# My Todo List

A simple todo list that runs locally on your machine. You can add, mark off, and delete todo items. In addition, you can filter out items that you've completed, uncomplete, or just show all of them.

## Things I learned:
- Components
- Props
- Use States (hooks)
- Use Effect
- Save to Local Storage
